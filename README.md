# python-threading-vs-multiprocessing
A Python project demonstrating the performance differences between threading and multiprocessing in CPU-bound tasks. It includes a script that measures execution time for both approaches, highlighting the impact of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The project provides a hands-on comparison for understanding parallel execution in Python.
